- **Landscape Optimization**: Dynamic card sizing for landscape orientation on mobile devices
- **Ultra-wide Display Support**: Optimized card dimensions for displays wider than 1920px
- **Device-Specific Breakpoints**: Extended from 5 to 9 responsive breakpoints for granular control

#### New Breakpoints:
- Very Small Mobile: < 360px (iPhone SE, small Android phones)
- Small Mobile: 360px - 479px
- Standard Mobile: 480px - 639px
- Large Mobile/Small Tablet: 640px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Small Desktop: 1024px - 1279px
- Medium Desktop: 1280px - 1535px
- Large Desktop: 1536px - 1919px
- Ultra-wide: â‰¥ 1920px

### 2. Intelligent Device Capability Detection
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS monitoring to detect low-performance devices
- **Device Type Detection**: Automatic detection of mobile, tablet, desktop, and their capabilities
- **Connection Speed Awareness**: Adaptive image loading based on network conditions
- **Power Optimization**: Reduced visual effects on battery-constrained devices

### 3. Enhanced Touch Gesture Recognition
- **Velocity-Based Swiping**: Smart threshold adjustment based on swipe velocity
- **Directional Lock**: Prevents accidental vertical scrolling during horizontal swipes
- **Boundary Resistance**: Natural rubber-band effect at scroll boundaries
- **Multi-touch Prevention**: Improved single-finger gesture handling

### 4. Advanced Scaling Algorithm
- **Device-Aware Scaling**: Different scale factors based on device performance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Higher quality effects on capable devices
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
- **High-DPI Optimization**: Specialized handling for high pixel density displays

### 5. Performance Optimizations

#### CSS Enhancements:
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Optimized GPU utilization across all devices
- **Containment**: CSS containment for better rendering performance
- **Transition Tuning**: Device-specific animation durations and easing
- **Battery Optimization**: Reduced effects during low battery conditions

#### JavaScript Optimizations:
- **Debounced Resize Handling**: Prevents excessive recalculations during resize
- **Frame Rate Monitoring**: Adaptive quality based on device performance
- **Memory Management**: Efficient cleanup of event listeners and observers
- **Lazy Loading**: Smart image loading priorities

### 6. Image Loading Strategy
- **Adaptive Quality**: Dynamic JPEG quality (70%-85%) based on device capabilities
- **Responsive Sizes**: Comprehensive `sizes` attribute for optimal image selection
- **Priority Loading**: Critical images loaded first, others lazy-loaded
- **Format Selection**: Automatic WebP/AVIF selection where supported

### 7. Accessibility Improvements
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility for users with contrast preferences
- **Reduced Motion**: Simplified animations for motion-sensitive users
- **Touch Target Optimization**: Appropriate touch target sizes across devices
- **Screen Reader Support**: Improved semantic markup and ARIA labels

## Technical Implementation Details

### Card Dimension Calculation
```javascript
// Enhanced viewport-aware calculations
const availableHeight = vh - logoHeight - wheelHeight - paddingSpace - safeAreaTop - safeAreaBottom;

// Device-specific width calculations
if (vw < 360) {
  setCardWidth(Math.min(200, vw * 0.7));
  setCardHeight(Math.min(availableHeight * 0.75, 280));
}
// ... additional breakpoints
```

### Advanced Scale Factors
```javascript
const getAdvancedScaleFactors = () => {
  const isLowPowerDevice = cardWidth < 300 && isHighDPI;
  
  return {
    center: isLowPowerDevice ? 1.05 : 1.1,
    adjacent: 0.65,
    far: 0.4
  };
};
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
const checkPerformance = () => {
  const frameDelta = now - lastFrameTime;
  const fps = 1000 / frameDelta;
  
  if (fps < 30) {
    enableLowPowerOptimizations();
  }
};
```

## Browser Support
- **Modern Browsers**: Full feature set (Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+)
- **Legacy Support**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Mobile Browsers**: Optimized for mobile Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- **Performance Monitoring**: Works with Performance Observer API where available

## Testing Coverage
- **Physical Devices**: iPhone SE to iPhone 15 Pro Max, various Android devices
- **Tablet Testing**: iPad Mini to iPad Pro 12.9", Android tablets
- **Desktop Testing**: 1080p to 4K displays, ultrawide monitors
- **Performance Testing**: Low-end to high-end device spectrum

## Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: < 2s on 3G networks
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s average
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3s on mobile devices
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB peak on mobile browsers
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal - optimized animations and reduced repaints

## Future Considerations
